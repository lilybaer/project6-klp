# *Store Websites | School Project*
This project showcases my work in building and enhancing online store websites using various web technologies and frameworks. It involved creating multiple versions of online store websites with dynamic and interactive components.

## Features
### Static Online Store
Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Node.js, Docker
Built a static online store structured with HTML and styled using CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive page layouts.
Deployed the store using GitHub Pages and set up the environment using Node.js within Docker containers.

### Dynamic Beverage Component
Technologies Used: Vue.js, TypeScript, Pinia
Created an interactive beverage customization component using Vue.js. Users can customize coffee recipes by selecting different creamers, syrups, and bases.
The component visually updates in real-time, with dynamic color changes reflecting user choices.

### State Management with Pinia
Used Pinia to manage the applicationâ€™s state and store user-selected beverage configurations, enabling users to save and retrieve custom coffee recipes.

### Advanced JavaScript Features
Event Handling: Implemented event handling techniques to enhance user interaction.
TypeScript Modules: Utilized TypeScript modules for better structure and maintainability of the codebase.
High Order Functions: Used high order functions to enhance the functionality and reusability of different components within the store
